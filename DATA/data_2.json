The hole in the middle of the table top keeps your parasol in place. The legs can easily be folded in to make the table easier to store.

The chair can be stacked, which helps you save space. The seat has a small edge at the back to keep a chair cushion in place. Made of high-quality, sustainably sourced eucalyptus. Eucalyptus is a durable, hard wood type suitable for outdoor use since it is compact and has a naturally high oil content that helps protect against weather and wind, drying out and mould. You can just shake off water from a light rain, as the cushion cover is water repellent.  Easy to secure the chair cushion to the chair with the elastic strap. No need to tie knots \u2012 just insert the plastic pin through the loop. The colour stays fresh for longer as the cushion cover is fade resistant. The cushion cover is easy to keep clean and fresh, as you can take it off and machine-wash it. Plastic feet protect the furniture when in contact with a moist surface. Combines with other products in the BONDHOLMEN series. Only recommended for outdoor use. If you do not want to use the elastic strap you can hide it in the small pocket on the side of the cushion.
